## The Lightrail Object Model
The full API object model is here for your reference. We will briefly discuss these objects and their relationships in this section. Note that depending on your use-case you may only need some of these objects and the corresponding endpoints. If you prefer to start with something more hands-on, feel free to move on to [Common Use-Cases](#use-cases-anchor).

### Core Objects: Lightrail Cards and Value Stores: 

The Card is the core concept in the Lightrail model and provides the main interface for storing, maintaining, and interacting with any sort of value that your business wishes to issue. Currently, there are two types of cards in Lightrail, _Gift Cards_ and _Account Cards_, which are distinguished based on the value of the `cardType` attribute on the `card` object. We will discuss these two types of cards in a bit.

A Card aggregates different values each of which is represented by a `valueStore` object. _Value Stores_ represent a specific instance of issued value and its attributes, such as its amount, validity period, and currency.

Each Card has at least one value store, known as the `principal` value store which holds the primary value of the Card and is issued at the time of card creation. Cards may also have many `attached` value stores which are created and attached to the Card as part of different promotional programs. 

Attached Value Stores are temporary; they are added to the Card as you create different promotional programs based on your business model, and may eventually expire or get canceled. The Principal Value Store, however, lasts throughout the lifetime of the Card. Once the Principal Value Store is expired or canceled, the Card is also considered expired or canceled.

For example, a customer can buy a gift card with a principal value of $30 which never expires. Later, and in order to encourage the recipient to spend the gift value,  you may attach a $5 promotional value to this Card as part of your _Back to School_ campaign, only valid in the last week of August. While this attached Value Store is active, the Card holder can spend $35 with the Card; when the attached Value Store expires at the end of August, the principal Value Store will still be valid and the Card can still spend up to $30.


### Programs
A Lightrail _Program_ is a template for issuing Value Stores which specifies their general attributes, such as currency, validity period, minimum/maximum amount, and the constraints that apply to spending them, known as _Redemption Rules_. 

Lightrail recognizes that issuing value seldom happens in isolation and is usually part of a broader organized context which is encapsulated in the concept of Program. Therefore, when creating a new Value Store, you always need to specify its reference  `program` object to which it belongs. As an analogy, think of Programs as minting facilities and Value Stores as coins. Valid coins can only be created by a minting facility and are subject to its broader rules and restrictions.

Lightrail currently supports two types of Programs which are differentiated based on their `type` attribute: 

- _Principal Programs_ are used to organize and create  `principal` Value Stores, namely to create new Cards, and
- _Promotional Programs_ are used to create `attached` Value Stores which can be added to existing cards and provide some additional promotional value to the card holder.

Programs are also a great way to group, organize, and analyze values. For example, you may want to know how many people took advantage of your _Back to School_ promotions and how it affected your sales. The Lightrail Web App provides various stats and analyses for the values created in each Program. 

Currently, you can only create programs using the Lightrail Web App.

### Gift Cards 

As the name implies, Gift Cards represent a value created as a gift. Lightrail Gift Cards have a `fullcode`,  a confidential, unique, and unguessable alpha-numeric code, which can be used as the evidence of possession of the Gift Card by its recipient. Lightrail allows balance-checking and value redemption based on the `fullcode`. This facilitates the checkout use-case in which the recipient of the Gift Card would manually enter the `fullcode` to redeem its value towards a purchase.

Since knowing the the `fullcode` implies possession of the Card, the `fullcode` is often delivered to the Gift Card's recipient in confidence. To further ensure this confidentiality and minimize the risk of accidentally revealing it in the course of passing JSON objects to the browser, aside from [the one endpoint](#get-fullcode-anchor) designated specifically to retrieving the `fullcode`, no other Lightrail API endpoint returns the `fullcode` in its response object.   

### Account Cards and Contacts 
Account Cards represent values associated with an individual customer, known in Lightrail as a _Contact_. An Account Cards can essentially be thought of as a customer's accounts, making them the suitable mechanism for implementing customer account credit or points programs. To further facilitate this, Lightrail enforces a one-card-per-currency-per-customer constraint on Account Cards so that each Contact can only have one account per each currency. This assumption makes handling transactions against account credits simpler as will be discussed in the [Accounts Credit Use-Case](#use-cases-account-credits-anchor).
Unlike Gift Cards, Account Cards do not have a `fullcode` and interactions with their value is only possible via the Card object interface.

### Transactions

Various interactions with the Lightrail system take place in the form of _Transactions_. The most common such Transactions are _funding_, _withdrawal_, and _refund_. Some other interactions such as Card _activation_, _cancellation_, and _freezing_/_unfreezing_ are also modelled as Transactions.

Lightrail also supports a two-step _pending_ withdrawal. A pending withdraw Transaction withholds the funds temporarily until eventually they are collected via a subsequent _capture_, or canceled via a _void_ Transaction. 

Posting Transactions against a Card is [primarily](#post-transaction-by-cardid-anchor) done via its `cardId`. However, to facilitate processing Gift Card redemption at the checkout which is one of the most common Gift Card use-cases, Lightrail also provides [an endpoint](#post-transaction-by-fullcode-anchor) for posting Transactions against a Card by its `fullcode`. To improve security, this endpoint only allows _withdrawals_.

One of the features of the Lightrail API is encapsulating the Card Value Stores behind a simple interface at the time of Transaction. While you can add many promotional attached Value Stores to Cards, at Transaction time, you do not need to worry about the logic of splitting withdrawals against the many Value Stores that may exist on the Card and Lightrail transaction processing logic automatically handles that logic for you. 

For example, if there is $30 in the principal Value Store and another $5 attached Value Store from a promotional _Back to School_ program, when attempting a $15 withdrawal, Lightrail automatically decides the break-down of this amount against existing Value Stores and you do not have to specify or even be aware of them. In this case, for example, Lightrail will prioritize the spending of the $5 value which is closer to its expiry date, and then, charges the remaining $10 from the principal Value Store.  

### Redemption Rules

Redemption Rules are a powerful feature of Lightrail which enable setting various sophisticated conditions in promotional programs, and thereby, on Value Stores that are derived from them. 

Redemption Rules can unlock powerful marketing promotions such as, "$10 off if you spend at least $100," or "$15 off if you buy two or more pairs of jeans." Currently, you can define such Redemption Rules at the time of creating a new Lightrail Program in the Lightrail Web App. 

When transacting against a Card, Redemption Rules determine whether or not each of the Card's Value Stores is redeemable in paying towards the transaction value. Every rule is essentially a Boolean expression which will be evaluated against the `metadata` provided by the transaction; the Value Store will be available for spending on that Transaction only if the rule evaluates to `true`. For example, the rule for a $5 promotion value if the customer spends at least $100 can be written as:

`metadata.cart.total >= 10000` 

in which the `cart` is a custom JSON object provided by your system as part of the `metadata` on Transactions. When this rule is added to a Program, a $5 Value Store derived from this Program will only be available to those Transactions which come with a `cart` object in which the `total` attribute is greater than $100. The following diagram depicts this process.

### Lightrail Cards and Value Stores: The Core Objects

The `card` is the core concept in the Lightrail model and provides the main interface for 
storing, maintaining, and interacting with any sort of value that your business wishes to issue.

A `card` aggregates different types of values each of which is modeled as a `valueStore`. 
Each card has at least one value store, known as the `principal` value store which holds the primary 
value of the card and is issued at the time of card creation. Each card may also have many `attached` value stores 
which are created and attached to the card as part of different promotional programs.

For example, a customer can buy a gift card with a principal value of USD 30 which never expires. 
Later, and in order to encourage the recipient to spending the gift value,  
you can add an attached value of USD 5 to this card as part of your _Back to School_ campaign and 
only valid for the last week of August. 
While this attached `valueStore` will expire at the end of August, the principal `valueStore`
will still maintain its value.   

Attached value stores can come and go as you create different promotional programs suitable 
for you business, but the principal value store remains throughout the lifetime of the card. 
Once the principal value store is expired or canceled, the card is considered expired or canceled.

###Programs
Lightrail `programs` are templates for issuing values by specifying overall attributes 
of the value, such as its currency, its validity period, and the constraints that apply to its spending, known as 
_redemption rules_.

There are two types of Cards: Gift Cards and Account Cards. 
These are both represented as a Card but with a different `cardType` attribute. 

#### Gift Cards

Gift Cards, as you might guess, are used when implementing a gift card program. Gift Cards have a `fullcode` which is a unique and unguessable alpha-numeric code that can be distributed to a recipient. 
In a standard gift card program, the recipient would manually enter the `fullcode` during the checkout process.

#### Account Cards

Account Cards represent value that is attached to a Contact. 
They are used when implementing a customer account credit or points program and can be thought of as a customer's account.
Since Account Cards do not have a `fullcode`, their value is interacted with using the Card object.
