## Cards [/cards/]
The _/cards_ endpoint is for use by your system to create and manage your Gift Cards and Account Cards.
The `cardId` should be stored as it's used in many subsequent requests - such as transaction against a Card. 
In use cases where the recipient requires a gift code, the `fullcode` should be supplied.
