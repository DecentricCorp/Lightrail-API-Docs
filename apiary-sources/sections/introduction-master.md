# Lightrail API

Welcome to the Lightrail API documentation. Lightrail is a powerful and flexible platform for digital account credits, gift cards, promotions, and points. 
Lightrail is carefully designed for rapid adoption and integration while maintaining flexibility to support various business use-cases and we would like this document 
to be part of that experience. In addition to a fully-interactive REST reference, we will have a quick overview of Lightrail's 
conceptual model, common use-cases, and common API calls with examples. 

Contact us anytime at hello@lightrail.com â€”we are here to help you solidify your use-cases and implementation.
