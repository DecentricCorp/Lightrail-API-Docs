# Lightrail API Resources

Welcome to Lightrail's API resources. For an overview and detailed summary of endpoints please visit our [interactive API docs](https://www.lightrail.com/docs). We recommend starting there.
They cover an overview of common use-cases, introduce the Lightrail object model, and provide the full endpoint list of the Lightrail API.
  
This repository hosts the API Blueprint file for the interactive documentation. Outside of those documents, there are additional resources that are listed under the [use-cases](/use-cases/readme.md) and [feature deep-dive](/feature-deep-dive/readme.md) directories.
  
We love customer feedback and contributions, so please report any errors or suggestions via a pull request.

## Use-Cases
This section provides detailed documents on implementing some common e-commerce use-cases using the Lightrail API. We provide an overview of the use-case and provide a step-by-step guide to API calls required to implement it.

- [Account Credits Powered by Lightrail](use-cases/account-credits.md)
- [Issuing Lightrail Gift Cards](use-cases/gift-card.md)

We're constantly looking to improve and expand our documentation. Please let us know if the use-case you are looking for is not here.
