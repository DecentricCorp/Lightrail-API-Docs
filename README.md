# Lightrail API

For an overview and detailed summary of endpoints please visit our [interactive API docs](https://www.lightrail.com/docs). We recommend starting there.
They cover an overview of common use-cases, introduce the Lightrail object model, and provide detailed breakdown of the Lightrail endpoints.
This repository hosts the API Blueprint file for the interactive docs.

We love customer feedback and contributions, so please report any errors or suggestions via a pull request.
  
Outside of the primary api document, within there are additional resources that are listed under the [use-cases](/use-cases) and [feature deep-dive](/feature-deep-dive) sections.

Note these documents are available either through the [GitHub repository][https://github.com/Giftbit/Lightrail-API-Docs] or alternative viewable through the [GitHub pages](https://giftbit.github.io/Lightrail-API-Docs/).
