# Redeeming a Lightrail Gift Code at Checkout

## Introduction

This document is a quick guide to adding gift code redemeption at the order checkout. The focus of this document is implementing this use by directly calling the Lightrail API. If you are looking for client libraries specific to a language or technology, check out our [integration projects](https://github.com/Giftbit/Lightrail-API-Docs/blob/usecases/Integrations.md).

## Use-Case

Redemption at the checkout is perhaps the most common use-case for a gift code. After creating an order, a customer who has previously received a gift code can redeem it at the checkout so that the value of the gift code can pay for part, or all of the order balance.

The common flow for this is to provice the customer with a space to enter the gift code at the checkout page, determine the value of the gift code, and adjust the order balance accordingly. If the gift code value is sufficient for covering the entire order balance, the balance is charged on the gift code and the checkout will be complete. If the gift code value is not enough, the gift code is charged with as much as it can contribute, usually its entire available value, and the remainder is paid using a third-party payment method such as a credit card.

### High-Level Flow

Based on this, the high-level steps to implement this use-case are as follows:

- Determine the value of the gift code.
- Determine the gift code's share in paying for the order and whether or not there is any remainder to be charged to another payment method.
- Charge the gift code and complete the order payment if the gift code has enough value to cover the whole order.
- Otherwise, follow an auth-capture protocol: first post a pending charge on the gift code, then attempt charging third-party payment method for the remainder. If the third-party payment is successful, collect the pending transaction on the gift code and complete the order payment. If the third-party payment failed, cancel the pending transaction on the gift code and declare failure for order payment.

### Common Error Cases

The following situations should lead to an error:

- In cases where the gift code value is not enough to pay for the entire order and there is a third-party payment method, payment failure from the third-party payment method is an error. In this case, aside from notifyin the customer, you should also cancel the pending transaction on the gift code.
- If the gift code value has a different currency than that of the order, the user should receive an error message. Note that Lightrail does not support currency exchange.
- If the gift code value is zero or it is inactive the customer should be notified of this as an error.
- Since some third-party payment methods have a restriction on the minimum transaction value, there is an edge case where the gift code value is too small to pay for the entire order, but also the order balance is so small that the remaining balance after taking out the gift code value will be too small for the third-party transaction. In these rare cases, the customer should be notified that the gift code value is too small for that transaction.

## Detailed Flow

The detailed logic and API calls for handling this use-case is discussed below. More details for each API endpoint and sample request/responses are provided in the next section but for a complete refrence and  further details, check out  [Lightrail API docs](https://www.lightrail.com/docs/).

1. Determine `orderBalance` and `orderCurrency` for the order at hand and collect the `giftCode` from the customer.

2. Use the [Balance API endpoint](#balance-endpoint) to determine the available value of the code (`giftCodeValue`), its `state`, and its `currency`. Prompt the user with an error if:
   - The gift code `state` is not `ACTIVE`, 
   - its value is zero, or
   - its currency does not match `orderCurrency`.

3. **If `giftCodeValue >= orderBalance`** , meaning the gift code value is enough for paying for the entire order, use the [Code Transaction API endpoint](#code-transaction-endpoint)  to charge the code with `orderBalance`. If this transaction is completed successfully, mark the order as completed, and optionally record the transaction details such the `transactionId` for future reference. If there is any error with this transaction, notify the customer that the checkout was not successful. 

4. **If `giftCodeValue < orderBalance`**, meaning the gift code value is not enough for paying for the entire order, the gift code will pay for part of the balance (`giftCodeShare`) and the remainder (i.e. `orderBalance - giftCodeShare`) will be paid via another payment method. 

   Usually, `giftCodeShare` is the value of the gift code, i.e. the maximum it can pay. However, in the edge case that the remainder is too small and would not meet the minimum-transaction-value requirements of the third-party payment method, you need to adjust the split a little bit to make sure the remainder is payable by the third-party payment method. Here is a code snippet based on our [Stripe Integration](https://github.com/Giftbit/lightrail-stripe-java) for handling this logic:

   ```java
   giftCodeShare = Math.min(orderBalance, giftCodeValue);
   int stripeShare = orderBalance - giftCodeShare;
   if (stripeShare > 0 && stripeShare < STRIPE_MINIMUM_TRANSACTION_VALUE) {
     int differential = STRIPE_MINIMUM_TRANSACTION_VALUE - stripeShare;
     giftCodeShare -= differential;
     if (giftCodeShare < 0)
       throw new InsufficientValueException("This gift code value is too small for this transaction.");
    }
   ```

   After determining the `giftCodeShare`, proceed with the following steps: 

   - Use the [Code Transaction API endpoint](#code-transaction-endpoint) to create a `pending` charge on the gift code with the value of `giftCodeShare`. Save the `transactionId` and the `cardId` from the response object.
   - Attempt charging the third-party payment method with the remainder of the order balane, i.e.`orderBalance - giftCodeShare`. 
   - If the the third-party payment is successful, use the [Card Transaction API endpoint](#card-transaction-endpoint) to capture the pending charge on the gift code. You need to provide the `cardId` and the original `transactionId` from the response to the pending transaction in this step.
   - If the third-party payment fails, use the [Card Transaction API endpoint](#card-transaction-endpoint) to cancel the pending charge on the gift code.  You need to provide the `cardId` and the original `transactionId` from the response to the pending transaction in this step.

The following sequence diagram summarizes these steps.

## API Endpoints

### Balance Endpoint

This endpoint provides a detailed breakdown of the gift code balance, as well as its currency and state, i.e. whether it is active. Usually, the balance of the gift code is returned in its `pricipal` value store, but if you are using gift codes with attached promotions (e.g. temporary promotional offers), these additional values are returned in the `attached` objects in the response. In such cases, the effective value of a gift code is the available value in its `principal` value store, plus the sum of all `attached` values that are currently active. So, in order to get the effective available value of a gift code you need to use the following logic:

```Php
giftCodeValue = balance.principal.currentValue;
foreach (balance.attached as attachedValue) {
  if (attachedValue.state === 'ACTIVE')
  	giftCodeValue += attachedValue.currentValue;
}
```

Request:

```json
GET https://api.lightrail.com/v1/codes/{giftCode}/card/balance
```

Response sample:

```JSON
{
    "balance": {
        "currency": "USD",
        "cardType": "GIFT_CARD",
        "balanceDate": "2017-07-11T00:40:52.104Z"
        "principal": {
            "currentValue": 541,
            "state": "ACTIVE",
            "expires": null,
            "startDate": null,
            "programId": "program-1d",
            "valueStoreId": "value-2f"
        },
        "attached": [
            {
                "currentValue": 500,
                "state": "ACTIVE",
                "expires": "2017-07-14T20:05:34.331Z",
                "startDate": null,
                "programId": "program-dd",
                "valueStoreId": "value-26"
            },
            {
                "currentValue": 0,
                "state": "ACTIVE",
                "expires": "2017-07-11T21:12:50.344Z",
                "startDate": null,
                "programId": "program-cc",
                "valueStoreId": "value-bb"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Code Transaction Endpoint

This endpoint enables posting a transaction to withdraw some value from a gift code. The value should be expressed as an integer, representing the amount in the smallest unit for the currency, e.g. cents.

The `userSuppliedId` is a per-endpoint unique idempotency key, i.e. client-side transaction identifier which is used to guarantee repeating a request, such as a request for a charge, will not repeat the corresponding operation if it has already been invoked once. For further details on this, see [Lightrail API docs](https://www.lightrail.com/docs/). Usually, you can generate a [Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) and use it as the `userSuppliedId`.

If `pending` is set to `true` in the request body, the transaction will be considered a pre-authorized transaction, and will have to be captured or voided later. 

After receiving the response to a pending transaction, save the `cardId` and  `transactionId` from the response object; they will be needed later when trying to `capture` or `void` the pending transaction.

Request Sample:

```JSON
POST https://api.lightrail.com/v1/codes/{giftCode}/transactions
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "value": -101
  "pending": true,
  "userSuppliedId": "072f0701-0e68-4676-9472-c24a96f88571",
}
```

Response Sample:

```json
{
    "transaction": {
        "transactionId": "transaction-b4",
        "value": -101,
        "userSuppliedId": "072f0701-0e68-4676-9472-c24a96f88571",
        "dateCreated": "2017-07-10T23:36:28.078Z",
        "transactionType": "PENDING_CREATE",
        "transactionAccessMethod": "RAWCODE",
        "giftbitUserId": "user-08",
        "cardId": "card-6d",
        "currency": "USD",
        "codeLastFour": "7KKT"
    }
}
```

### Card Transaction Endpoint

After posting a `pending` transaction, you can use this endpoint to either capture or void it. Note that in order to call this endpoint you will need the `cardId` corresponding to the gift code and the `transactionId` for the original pending transaction which are provided in the response object from the original call to create the pending transaction.

Request Samples:

```JSON
POST https://api.lightrail.com/v1/cards/{cardId}/transactions/{transactionId}/void
{
  "userSuppliedId":"072f0701-0e68-4676-9472-c24a96f88571",
}
```

```JSON
POST https://api.lightrail.com/v1/cards/{cardId}/transactions/{transactionId}/capture
{
  "userSuppliedId":"072f0701-0e68-4676-9472-c24a96f88571",
}
```

Response Sample:

```JSON
{
    "transaction": {
        "transactionId": "transaction-a7",
        "value": 101,
        "userSuppliedId": "transaction-46-reverse",
        "dateCreated": "2017-07-12T00:22:48.379Z",
        "transactionType": "PENDING_VOID",
        "transactionAccessMethod": "CARDID",
        "giftbitUserId": "user-08",
        "cardId": "card-6d",
        "currency": "USD",
        "parentTransactionId": "transaction-46",
        "metadata": {
            "giftbit_initial_transaction_id": "transaction-46"
        },
        "codeLastFour": "7KKT"
    }
}

```
